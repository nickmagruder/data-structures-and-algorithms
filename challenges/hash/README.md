# 30 - Hash Tables
[Hash Table](challenges/hash/hash.js)

## Hashtable
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

### Approach and Efficiency
- Separate Chaining Method
    - Time Efficiency: O(1)
    - Space Efficiency:
